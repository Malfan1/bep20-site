Every social media influencer and so-called entrepreneurs “lecture” about crypto investments and marketing. But none of these are standard. And most of the time, these crypto modules are costly. This is where BEP-20 Learn to Earn strategy comes in. </p>
                        <p class="what-is-learn__words">BEP-20 presents our community with the opportunities to learn these investment modules and courses. At the end of each course or module, you will earn. With the spirit of inclusiveness and encouraging communities to learn more, the learn-to-earn incentive programs were built. Those who read or watch videos to complete a certain number of modules or unlock badges are rewarded for their hard work with tokens.</p>
