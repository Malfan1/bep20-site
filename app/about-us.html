                    <p class="few-words__p">Imagine a decentralized financial system, made absolutely to be governed by you. Seems like an unbelievable technological revolution, right? </p>
                    <p class="few-words__p">What if we tell you that the revolution has begun and exchanging, lending, staking or borrowing funds can now be controlled via a permission less, and reliable network fully formed in a peer-to-peer mode?</p>

                    <p class="few-words__p">For ages, we have been using banks or other financial organizations that exercised a strong centralized management on our finances. But we now have the facility to practice decentralized finance (DeFi) to establish a complete governance on our finances. Blockchain systems will now either update their procedures or will go obsolete, since the old blockchain methodologies do not have proper DeFi platform representation techniques. To ensure no third party interferes in your transactions and you have the utter power to regulate your trades, several decentralized autonomous organizations are providing a self-banking opportunity in a flexibly programmable and encoded system. </p>
                    <p class="few-words__p">We introduce the BEP-20 network, a community based initiative that specifically targets anyone who prefers his transactions without any third party interactions. Our community includes investors, gamers, and developers who stand with us in establishing an equality based financial system that is sustainable, accountable and completely transparent, providing everyone the equal opportunity to generate wealth regardless of his economic status. </p>

                    <h2 class="why-us__title">But why us?</h2>
                    <p class="why-us__words">Our proposal for the development of such a community has been enabled by the blockchain, and will abolish the necessity of third party interventions, that cost us time and unnecessary transaction charges. In addition to that, we are influencing blockchain functionality tools as well, such as NFTs, smart contracts and DApps to amalgamate a community whereby users can practice DeFi and earn a grand worth of wealth.</p>
                    <p class="why-us__words">BEP-20 is about deriving the historical trends to formulate new and better ones by establishing a society where economy is decentralized, and the concept of elites or poor does not exist. We look forward to a bright future where all classes of people can benefit from equal wealth generation while performing multiple financial actions in an equally progressive community. </p>
